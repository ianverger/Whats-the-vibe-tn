"What's the vibe tn?" is a data visualization in which users will be able to move around a highly interactive map of the Lower Manhattan/North Brooklyn area to peruse a hand-selected collection of top-notch bars, lounges, and clubs, based on a selected category. 

Depending on the category selected (Dive, Cocktail, Rooftop, Rave, etc.), the map will filter the corresponding establishments and provide information to the user including hours of operation, customer rating, a brief description, and other bars in the general area that they could potentially move to in order to elevate their evening.

The view and entire "vibe" of the page will shift depening on the vibe the user currently has selected. Options to "switch up the vibe" will list alternative bar options in the area that offer a different atmosphere.
